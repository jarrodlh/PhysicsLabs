Black Holes masses will be in solar units
Orbital speeds for inital black hole velocities will be calculated by Sqrt(G*M/R)
Inital location of the black holes is determined by placing them on oposite sides of a circle
Assume the star is massless so that the black hole's orbit stays stable
Black holes will be 1000 solar masses and seperated by 10 AU for an orbital speed of 9.96*10^-4 times the speed of light
